Hs2client is a mysql Handler Socket Scala Client

If you have no idea about the Handler Socket Plugin of Mysql Database, google it :O)

With Hs2client, I want to make anything possible be transparent to the users, some features may be:
<1> automatically generate index id, but can be customized if necessary;
<2> return all of the columns by default , but can be filtered if necessary; 
<3> customized connection pooling;
<4> easy to use and configure.
<5> others...


TODO Next Stage:
1- add connection pooling support;
2- implement Hs2ClientTemplate to ease the usage of the API.
